Once upon a time a superhero slept in.
She was tried of fixing the mess that the human beings kept making.
Her motivation was at an all time low.
There was a scratching at the door, she'd forgotten her dog was still locked outside.
The scratching became more intense - she hesitantly approached the door, hand gripping the cold brass handle.
She looked through the peephole and saw a creepy dude dressed as a dalmation scratching and crawling around on all fours.
"Nope." she thought.
